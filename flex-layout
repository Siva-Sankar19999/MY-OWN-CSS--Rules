/* very important concept Flex properties */

.flex{

    display:flex;             /* in bootstrap d-flex */
    flex-direction:row;      /* in bootstrap flex-row,  main axis */
    justify-content:flex-start center  flex-end space-between space-around ; /* Alignment of items in main axis direction */
    align-items: stretch(default property) flex-start center flex-end;
    /* when we choose flex-direction. Items will stretch in oppposite direction i.e; cross axis and stretch will controlled by property align-items */
    flex-wrap :nowrap (default value) wrap ;       /* we have to put */ flex-wrap : wrap ; /*otherwise items will forcefully fill in one row when we choose flex-direction:row; */
    


    align-self: stretch auto flex-end flex-start center;
    /* we can move flex items individually in cross direction ..... attribute auto means it inherit parent property i.e; align-items */
    
    order: -1 0 1 ; 

    we can change order of flex items forward and backward by using order 

    flex-grow: 0 (default value) , 1 , 2;

    /* when they are less flex items in row and we have more space to take over and -> we can increase the size of those flex items by using flex-grow: 0 , 1,2; */
    /* we have to specify to individual items like we have already  applied in  align-self,order properties */



    flex-shrink : 0, 1(default value);

    when we do flex-shrink :0;
    we are saying not to shrink when there is no space for them...
    and we have to apply them individual items....saying not to shrink....
